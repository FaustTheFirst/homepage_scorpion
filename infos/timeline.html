I'm formerly one of the finest warriors of the Japanese Shirai Ryu ninja clan, until I was slain by Bi-Han, a member of
the Lin Kuei (a rival clan of Chinese assassins) who worked under the name
"Sub-Zero". I became a "hellspawn" revenant residing in Hell, later called the Netherrealm, who sought vengeance
against those responsible for the destruction of my clan and the murder of my family, including my wife Harumi and
my son Satoshi. Although essentially neutral in allegiance, I join forces with anyone who can assist in my
plans of revenge. I was once manipulated by the sorcerer Quan Chi, whom I promised my life to in exchange for my
impressive kombat abilities in order to defeat Sub-Zero.

Mortal Kombat (1992)
My first role, oh Gods! I am described as only having enmity
towards Sub-Zero, which was attributed to rivalries between our opposing ninja clans. My ending revealed that I was
actually an undead specter who had been killed by Sub-Zero and was survived by a wife and child. This was further
explored in a tie-in comic book written and illustrated by MK co-creator John Tobias and published by Midway. In a
one-page scene, set aboard a junk en route to Mortal Kombat tournament host Shang Tsung's private island, I
shock Sub-Zero with my unexpected return exactly two years after my death, declaring that my "demons" had allowed
me to return and avenge me demise. After Shokan Prince Goro's defeat at the hands of eventual champion Liu Kang,
Shang Tsung's army launched an attack, forcing me to team up with Sub-Zero, the thunder god Raiden, and other
tournament survivors to hold them back before he killed his rival and disappeared.

Mortal Kombat II (1993)
I discover that Sub-Zero has somehow returned, and I planned to compete in the second
Mortal Kombat tournament held in the otherworldly dimension of Outworld and hosted by the realm's emperor Shao Kahn. I
track his nemesis down but notice, in the process, Sub-Zero sparing the life of an opponent in battle. I
realize that this is not Bi-Han, but instead his younger brother, Kuai Liang, who had taken on his brother's codename
in his memory and was tasked with completing his failed mission of assassinating Shang Tsung. As a result, I
vowed to serve as the new Sub-Zero's guardian in atonement for killing his older brother.

Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks (2005)
In this spin-off, set during the events of Mortal Kombat II, I am a
boss character who attempts to kill the game's playable protagonists Liu Kang and Kung Lao. I appeared in both masked
and unmasked forms, with the latter being named "Inferno Scorpion".
The planned co-op game, Mortal Kombat: Fire & Ice,
which would have starred me and Sub-Zero as the protagonists, was canceled when Paradox Development, the
developers of Shaolin Monks, "couldn't do it in time and under budget."

Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 (1995)
I did not take a part of Mortal Kombat 3, because, you now, I just needed to take a little break, so much work we all
had those days. But I returned in the 1995 upgrade Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 when Shao Kahn tried to conquer the
Netherrealm after his invasion
of Earth, and enlisted the ninja in his forces. My allegiance to the Kahn quickly dissolved when I discover,
in a continuance of my MKII storyline, that Sub-Zero was one of Earth's chosen warriors, with whom I sided in our
final showdown with Shao Kahn.

Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero (1997)
I am featured therein as an unplayable boss character, appearing twice
throughout the game. Despite playing a minor role, my background was officially expanded in a feature on the game's
official website, where my real name and that of my clan were revealed, while my yellow outfit was described as an
apparent mockery of the Lin Kuei after former Lin Kuei member Takeda developed ninjutsu before leaving the clan and
forming the rival Shirai Ryu. I am enlisted by Quan Chi to find a map hidden in a Shaolin temple, a task the
sorcerer also gave to Sub-Zero in order to engage the two rival ninjas in combat. If the player performs a killer move
on me, I will reappear as another boss later in the game.
Mortal Kombat 4 (1997)
Quan Chi tricked me
into believing that Sub-Zero was involved in the deaths of my family and clan, resulting in the specter allying with
me. In my ending, I emerge victorious over Sub-Zero, but Quan Chi reveals his involvement in killing
mine clan and family. When the sorcerer attempts to banish me, I grab the former at the last
minute, sending us both to the Netherrealm. A variation of this ending was seen in Sub-Zero's conclusion, when
Sub-Zero stands over a fallen me before being knocked down by Quan Chi, who again reveals his scheme and claims
us both ninjas were pawns for the fallen Elder God Shinnok, which results in me killing Quan Chi and declaring
Sub-Zero free of his curse.

Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance (2002)
My MK4 ending is carried over into Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance (2002), where I relentlessly hunt down Quan
Chi, only to be attacked by the Oni Drahmin and Moloch, whom the sorcerer had hired as protection and to help free him
from the Netherrealm. In my non-canonical ending, I am killed when Drahmin and Moloch hurl me into a Soulnado,
a magical tornado consisting of tormented souls trapped between Earthrealm and Outworld.

Mortal Kombat: Deception (2004)
In mine biography in
Mortal Kombat: Deception however, I am depicted as having escaped as well. I meet the Elder Gods, which, coupled with
my witnessing Raiden's death and the emergence of Onaga, the Dragon King, cause me to accept a new role as the Elder
Gods' servant while working to prevent Onaga's merging of the realms.

Mortal Kombat: Armageddon (2006)
In the Konquest mode of Mortal Kombat: Armageddon (2006), I cut a deal with the Elder Gods to serve them in
exchange for the resurrection of the Shirai Ryu and my wife and son. However, they resurrect them as undead beings.
Enraged, I seek to destroy the Elder Gods' chance of preventing Armageddon by taking the elemental Blaze's
power, but the Edenian demigod Taven defeats me and I am later killed by Sub-Zero in a battle royal amongst the series
characters in the game's opening sequence.

Mortal Kombat (2011)
In the 2011 Mortal Kombat reboot, an alternative-timeline retelling of the first three titles, I reprise my
role from the first game in seeking vengeance against the elder Sub-Zero, Bi-Han. This time though, I serve Quan Chi
from the start, unaware that the sorcerer is the mastermind behind the murder of my family and clan. Raiden, attempting
to alter the timeline in hopes of averting Armageddon, talks to me into sparing Sub-Zero's life in exchange for
reviving the Shirai Ryu. I agree, and when I defeat Sub-Zero in the Netherrealm, I refuse to kill him.
However, Quan Chi convinces me otherwise by showing me a graphic vision of Sub-Zero murdering my wife and child.
Despite Sub-Zero protests, I promptly incinerate him. I reappear on the tournament grounds holding Sub-Zero's
skull and spinal column. Later in the game, the younger Sub-Zero Kuai Liang seeks revenge for his brother's death by
demanding a fight with me in Shao Kahn's arena, which Quan Chi grants. I immediately recognize the new
Sub-Zero as the original's younger brother, and while I am defeated, Kuai Liang is apprehended by my clan before I
finish the revenant off. I am last seen when I fight and lose to Raiden in the Netherrealm before
disappearing. In my non-canonical arcade ending, the Shirai Ryu appear before me as ghostly apparitions who
reveal the truth about their murder and aid me in killing Quan Chi for his deception. In Sub-Zero's ending, I learn
the truth about his and mine families and offers the specter a chance to join him in his quest for vengeance.
I accept, joining Sub-Zero to form our own Deadly Alliance.

Mortal Kombat X (2015)
In Mortal Kombat X, which takes place two years after the previous game, I was sent to attack the Special Forces
alongside a revenant version of Kuai Liang. Due to the efforts of Raiden and his allies however, they were restored to
their human forms and freed from Quan Chi's control. Over the course of the following two decades, the newly restored
me as Hanzo Hasashi reformed the Shirai Ryu, trained Kenshi's son Takeda Takahashi, and made amends with the young
Sub-Zero
after I revealed Quan Chi was responsible for the murder of my family and clan. When the Special Forces captured Quan
Chi, a revenge-minded I subdued them and released the sorcerer so I could challenge him to a final fight before
I killed him. Concurrently, Quan Chi's associate D'Vorah appeared so she could have the sorcerer free Shinnok from his
amulet. I decapitated Quan Chi, but not before he could finish reciting a spell to successfully free the fallen
Elder God, who immediately incapacitated everyone in the surrounding area.

Mortal Kombat 11 (2019)
In Mortal Kombat 11, I continue to lead the Shirai Ryu in protecting Earthrealm as its Grandmaster a further two
years after MKX and Shinnok's defeat. When the keeper of time Kronika caused a time anomaly in an attempt to erase
Raiden from history, she brought a past version of me to the present so she could recruit him to her fold with the
promise of resurrecting my clan and family. Meanwhile, I worked with Sub-Zero to foil Lin Kuei clansman
turned cyber ninja Sektor and his plans to build a Cyber Lin Kuei army. They were successful, despite facing opposition
from Bi-Han, who had been resurrected as the revenant Noob Saibot, and learning that Sektor played a role in murdering
mine clan and family. After Kronika's forces compromise or destroy most of their bases, I agrees to house
my Earthrealm allies at the Shirai Ryu's Fire Gardens. To help locate Kronika's Keep, I suggest forging an
alliance with Kharon, a ferryman who transports unfortunate souls to the Netherrealm who Sub-Zero and I met while we
were revenants. I succeed in recruiting Kharon and convincing my younger self to turn away from Kronika, but I
am killed by D'Vorah. With my dying breath, I urges my younger self to abandon his pursuit of vengeance and defend
Earthrealm. Younger me keeps his word and joins the allied forces of Earthrealm and Outworld to stop Kronika.
In my non-canonical arcade ending, the younger me fails to keep his promise to his future self, and kills Kronika
so he can restart history to ensure his loved ones' survival. When he discovers that otherworldly forces conspire to
make sure the tragedy always repeats itself, he undergoes a quest for revenge against them.
