                                <p>
                                  I'm formerly one of the finest warriors of the
                                  Japanese Shirai Ryu ninja clan, until I was slain by
                                  Bi-Han, a member of the Lin Kuei (a rival clan of
                                  Chinese assassins) who worked under the name
                                  "Sub-Zero". I became a "hellspawn" revenant residing
                                  in Hell, later called the Netherrealm, who sought
                                  vengeance against those responsible for the
                                  destruction of my clan and the murder of my family,
                                  including my wife Harumi and my son Satoshi.
                                  Although essentially neutral in allegiance, I join
                                  forces with anyone who can assist in my plans of
                                  revenge. I was once manipulated by the sorcerer Quan
                                  Chi, whom I promised my life to in exchange for my
                                  impressive kombat abilities in order to defeat
                                  Sub-Zero.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                  My first role, oh Gods! I am described as only
                                  having enmity towards Sub-Zero, which was attributed
                                  to rivalries between our opposing ninja clans. My
                                  ending revealed that I was actually an undead
                                  specter who had been killed by Sub-Zero and was
                                  survived by a wife and child. This was further
                                  explored in a tie-in comic book written and
                                  illustrated by MK co-creator John Tobias and
                                  published by Midway. In a one-page scene, set aboard
                                  a junk en route to Mortal Kombat tournament host
                                  Shang Tsung's private island, I shock Sub-Zero with
                                  my unexpected return exactly two years after my
                                  death, declaring that my "demons" had allowed me to
                                  return and avenge me demise. After Shokan Prince
                                  Goro's defeat at the hands of eventual champion Liu
                                  Kang, Shang Tsung's army launched an attack, forcing
                                  me to team up with Sub-Zero, the thunder god Raiden,
                                  and other tournament survivors to hold them back
                                  before he killed his rival and disappeared.

                                  I discover that Sub-Zero has somehow returned, and I
                                  planned to compete in the second Mortal Kombat
                                  tournament held in the otherworldly dimension of
                                  Outworld and hosted by the realm's emperor Shao
                                  Kahn. I track his nemesis down but notice, in the
                                  process, Sub-Zero sparing the life of an opponent in
                                  battle. I realize that this is not Bi-Han, but
                                  instead his younger brother, Kuai Liang, who had
                                  taken on his brother's codename in his memory and
                                  was tasked with completing his failed mission of
                                  assassinating Shang Tsung. As a result, I vowed to
                                  serve as the new Sub-Zero's guardian in atonement
                                  for killing his older brother.

                                  In this spin-off, set during the events of Mortal
                                  Kombat II, I am a boss character who attempts to
                                  kill the game's playable protagonists Liu Kang and
                                  Kung Lao. I appeared in both masked and unmasked
                                  forms, with the latter being named "Inferno
                                  Scorpion". The planned co-op game, Mortal Kombat:
                                  Fire & Ice, which would have starred me and Sub-Zero
                                  as the protagonists, was canceled when Paradox

                                  "couldn't do it in time and under budget."

                                  I did not take a part of Mortal Kombat 3, because,
                                  you now, I just needed to take a little break, so
                                  much work we all had those days. But I returned in
                                  the 1995 upgrade Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 when Shao
                                  Kahn tried to conquer the Netherrealm after his
                                  invasion of Earth, and enlisted the ninja in his
                                  forces. My allegiance to the Kahn quickly dissolved
                                  when I discover, in a continuance of my MKII
                                  storyline, that Sub-Zero was one of Earth's chosen
                                  warriors, with whom I sided in our final showdown
                                  with Shao Kahn.

                                  I am featured therein as an unplayable boss
                                  character, appearing twice throughout the game.
                                  Despite playing a minor role, my background was
                                  officially expanded in a feature on the game's
                                  official website, where my real name and that of my
                                  clan were revealed, while my yellow outfit was
                                  described as an apparent mockery of the Lin Kuei
                                  after former Lin Kuei member Takeda developed
                                  ninjutsu before leaving the clan and forming the
                                  rival Shirai Ryu. I am enlisted by Quan Chi to find
                                  a map hidden in a Shaolin temple, a task the
                                  sorcerer also gave to Sub-Zero in order to engage
                                  the two rival ninjas in combat. If the player
                                  performs a killer move on me, I will reappear as
                                  another boss later in the game.

                                  Quan Chi tricked me into believing that Sub-Zero was
                                  involved in the deaths of my family and clan,
                                  resulting in the specter allying with me. In my
                                  ending, I emerge victorious over Sub-Zero, but Quan
                                  Chi reveals his involvement in killing mine clan and
                                  family. When the sorcerer attempts to banish me, I
                                  grab the former at the last minute, sending us both
                                  to the Netherrealm. A variation of this ending was
                                  seen in Sub-Zero's conclusion, when Sub-Zero stands
                                  over a fallen me before being knocked down by Quan
                                  Chi, who again reveals his scheme and claims us both
                                  ninjas were pawns for the fallen Elder God Shinnok,
                                  which results in me killing Quan Chi and declaring
                                  Sub-Zero free of his curse.

                                  In the 2011 Mortal Kombat reboot, an
                                  alternative-timeline retelling of the first three
                                  titles, I reprise my role from the first game in
                                  seeking vengeance against the elder Sub-Zero,
                                  Bi-Han. This time though, I serve Quan Chi from the
                                  start, unaware that the sorcerer is the mastermind
                                  behind the murder of my family and clan. Raiden,
                                  attempting to alter the timeline in hopes of
                                  averting Armageddon, talks to me into sparing
                                  Sub-Zero's life in exchange for reviving the Shirai
                                  Ryu. I agree, and when I defeat Sub-Zero in the
                                  Netherrealm, I refuse to kill him. However, Quan Chi
                                  convinces me otherwise by showing me a graphic
                                  vision of Sub-Zero murdering my wife and child.
                                  Despite Sub-Zero protests, I promptly incinerate
                                  him. I reappear on the tournament grounds holding
                                  Sub-Zero's skull and spinal column. Later in the
                                  game, the younger Sub-Zero Kuai Liang seeks revenge
                                  for his brother's death by demanding a fight with me
                                  in Shao Kahn's arena, which Quan Chi grants. I
                                  immediately recognize the new Sub-Zero as the
                                  original's younger brother, and while I am defeated,
                                  Kuai Liang is apprehended by my clan before I finish
                                  the revenant off. I am last seen when I fight and
                                  lose to Raiden in the Netherrealm before
                                  disappearing. In my non-canonical arcade ending, the
                                  Shirai Ryu appear before me as ghostly apparitions
                                  who reveal the truth about their murder and aid me
                                  in killing Quan Chi for his deception. In Sub-Zero's
                                  ending, I learn the truth about his and mine
                                  families and offers the specter a chance to join him
                                  in his quest for vengeance. I accept, joining
                                  Sub-Zero to form our own Deadly Alliance.

                                  In Mortal Kombat X, which takes place two years
                                  after the previous game, I was sent to attack the
                                  Special Forces alongside a revenant version of Kuai
                                  Liang. Due to the efforts of Raiden and his allies
                                  however, they were restored to their human forms and
                                  freed from Quan Chi's control. Over the course of
                                  the following two decades, the newly restored me as
                                  Hanzo Hasashi reformed the Shirai Ryu, trained
                                  Kenshi's son Takeda Takahashi, and made amends with
                                  the young Sub-Zero after I revealed Quan Chi was
                                  responsible for the murder of my family and clan.
                                  When the Special Forces captured Quan Chi, a
                                  revenge-minded I subdued them and released the
                                  sorcerer so I could challenge him to a final fight
                                  before I killed him. Concurrently, Quan Chi's
                                  associate D'Vorah appeared so she could have the
                                  sorcerer free Shinnok from his amulet. I decapitated
                                  Quan Chi, but not before he could finish reciting a
                                  spell to successfully free the fallen Elder God, who
                                  immediately incapacitated everyone in the
                                  surrounding area.

                                  In Mortal Kombat 11, I continue to lead the Shirai
                                  Ryu in protecting Earthrealm as its Grandmaster a
                                  further two years after MKX and Shinnok's defeat.
                                  When the keeper of time Kronika caused a time
                                  anomaly in an attempt to erase Raiden from history,
                                  she brought a past version of me to the present so
                                  she could recruit him to her fold with the promise
                                  of resurrecting my clan and family. Meanwhile, I
                                  worked with Sub-Zero to foil Lin Kuei clansman
                                  turned cyber ninja Sektor and his plans to build a
                                  Cyber Lin Kuei army. They were successful, despite
                                  facing opposition from Bi-Han, who had been
                                  resurrected as the revenant Noob Saibot, and
                                  learning that Sektor played a role in murdering mine
                                  clan and family. After Kronika's forces compromise
                                  or destroy most of their bases, I agrees to house my
                                  Earthrealm allies at the Shirai Ryu's Fire Gardens.
                                  To help locate Kronika's Keep, I suggest forging an
                                  alliance with Kharon, a ferryman who transports
                                  unfortunate souls to the Netherrealm who Sub-Zero
                                  and I met while we were revenants. I succeed in
                                  recruiting Kharon and convincing my younger self to
                                  turn away from Kronika, but I am killed by D'Vorah.
                                  With my dying breath, I urges my younger self to
                                  abandon his pursuit of vengeance and defend
                                  Earthrealm. Younger me keeps his word and joins the
                                  allied forces of Earthrealm and Outworld to stop
                                  Kronika. In my non-canonical arcade ending, the
                                  younger me fails to keep his promise to his future
                                  self, and kills Kronika so he can restart history to
                                  ensure his loved ones' survival. When he discovers
                                  that otherworldly forces conspire to make sure the
                                  tragedy always repeats itself, he undergoes a quest
                                  for revenge against them.
