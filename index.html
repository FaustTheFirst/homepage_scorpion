                                I'm formerly one of the finest warriors of the
                                Japanese Shirai Ryu ninja clan, until I was slain by
                                Bi-Han, a member of the Lin Kuei (a rival clan of
                                Chinese assassins) who worked under the name
                                "Sub-Zero". I became a "hellspawn" revenant residing
                                in Hell, later called the Netherrealm, who sought
                                vengeance against those responsible for the
                                destruction of my clan and the murder of my family,
                                including my wife Harumi and my son Satoshi.
                                Although essentially neutral in allegiance, I join
                                forces with anyone who can assist in my plans of
                                revenge. I was once manipulated by the sorcerer Quan
                                Chi, whom I promised my life to in exchange for my
                                impressive kombat abilities in order to defeat
                                Sub-Zero.

                                My first role, oh Gods! I am described as only
                                having enmity towards Sub-Zero, which was attributed
                                to rivalries between our opposing ninja clans. My
                                ending revealed that I was actually an undead
                                specter who had been killed by Sub-Zero and was
                                survived by a wife and child. This was further
                                explored in a tie-in comic book written and
                                illustrated by MK co-creator John Tobias and
                                published by Midway. In a one-page scene, set aboard
                                a junk en route to Mortal Kombat tournament host
                                Shang Tsung's private island, I shock Sub-Zero with
                                my unexpected return exactly two years after my
                                death, declaring that my "demons" had allowed me to
                                return and avenge me demise. After Shokan Prince
                                Goro's defeat at the hands of eventual champion Liu
                                Kang, Shang Tsung's army launched an attack, forcing
                                me to team up with Sub-Zero, the thunder god Raiden,
                                and other tournament survivors to hold them back
                                before he killed his rival and disappeared.

                                I discover that Sub-Zero has somehow returned, and I
                                planned to compete in the second Mortal Kombat
                                tournament held in the otherworldly dimension of
                                Outworld and hosted by the realm's emperor Shao
                                Kahn. I track his nemesis down but notice, in the
                                process, Sub-Zero sparing the life of an opponent in
                                battle. I realize that this is not Bi-Han, but
                                instead his younger brother, Kuai Liang, who had
                                taken on his brother's codename in his memory and
                                was tasked with completing his failed mission of
                                assassinating Shang Tsung. As a result, I vowed to
                                serve as the new Sub-Zero's guardian in atonement
                                for killing his older brother.

                                I did not take a part of Mortal Kombat 3, because,

                                described as an apparent mockery of the Lin Kuei

                                titles, I reprise my role from the first game in

                                Bi-Han. This time though, I serve Quan Chi from the
                                start, unaware that the sorcerer is the mastermind
                                behind the murder of my family and clan. Raiden,
                                attempting to alter the timeline in hopes of
                                averting Armageddon, talks to me into sparing

                                Ryu. I agree, and when I defeat Sub-Zero in the
                                Netherrealm, I refuse to kill him. However, Quan Chi
                                convinces me otherwise by showing me a graphic
                                vision of Sub-Zero murdering my wife and child.
                                Despite Sub-Zero protests, I promptly incinerate
                                him. I reappear on the tournament grounds holding

                                for his brother's death by demanding a fight with me
                                in Shao Kahn's arena, which Quan Chi grants. I

                                Earthrealm allies at the Shirai Ryu's Fire Gardens.
                                To help locate Kronika's Keep, I suggest forging an
                                alliance with Kharon, a ferryman who transports
                                unfortunate souls to the Netherrealm who Sub-Zero
                                and I met while we were revenants. I succeed in
                                recruiting Kharon and convincing my younger self to
                                turn away from Kronika, but I am killed by D'Vorah.
                                With my dying breath, I urges my younger self to
                                abandon his pursuit of vengeance and defend
                                Earthrealm. Younger me keeps his word and joins the
                                allied forces of Earthrealm and Outworld to stop
                                Kronika. In my non-canonical arcade ending, the
                                younger me fails to keep his promise to his future
                                self, and kills Kronika so he can restart history to
                                ensure his loved ones' survival. When he discovers
                                that otherworldly forces conspire to make sure the
                                tragedy always repeats itself, he undergoes a quest
                                for revenge against them.
